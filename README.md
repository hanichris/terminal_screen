# TERMINAL SCREEN

## Introduction.

Terminal screen is a program that takes as its input a stream of bytes in the following format

```
+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+--- ··· ---+----------------+
| Command Byte | Length Byte | Data Byte 0 | Data Byte 1 | ··· | Data Byte n-1 |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+--- ··· ---+----------------+
```

and draws the output of the operation that this stream of bytes encodes to a screen in the terminal window from which the program was launched. This stream of bytes acts as a means of communication between two active processes, a concept that plays a role in the design of the program.

The data format of the byte stream is an array of bytes categorized into sections that start with a command byte, which specifies the desired operation, a length byte that captures how many arguments the command takes and finally a sequence of data bytes that act as the arguments to the command.

## Architectural design.

The format presented within the introduction is reminiscent of bytecode generated by interpreted languages like **Python**. As such, terminal screen is broken down into two sections:

## Execution.

### Requiremets.

1. gcc version 14.
2. make
3. Unix-like OS.
4. C23

### Demo.

Run the following to build terminal screen and generate two executables:

```bash
make
```
